Why we need junit testing:- If there are 8 members in a team and all are working on other layers.
 Now let's condider I am working on Service layer and have to start my task than I will create my functionality and 
 test it with the help of junit testing 
 see in both tests I am able to test my own layer functionality without touching other layer
 For Example:-
 EmployeeServiceTest give output(after running junit test) as :- called service
 only output of service and no other layer get or involve
